### Work Experience
NLP Engineer (August 2023 – Present)
RevSavvy| Remote

• Architected a custom PDF parsing service, seamlessly integrating with a RoBERTa based NLP model via REST API. This 
innovation set new benchmarks in software release note analysis, offering precise labeling and confidence scoring, and 
equipping users with unparalleled insights for strategic decisions

Data Engineer (Jan 2023 – May 2023)
CVS Health | Irving, Texas 

• Improved data quality and consistency through ETL optimization, reducing data errors by 20%
• Automated data pipelines utilizing PySpark and DAGs using Apache Airflow, resulting in improved system efficiency 
and reliability
• Automated the deployment of machine learning models in production using Kubeflow. It involved setting up 
workflows to train, test, and deploy multiple models, ensuring that they are optimized for performance and scalability
• Collaborated with Marketing and Sales Teams to identify customer segments and tailor data-driven strategies for the
creation of new offers, coupons, and discounts, boosting customer engagement.

Data Scientist (August 2022 – Dec 2022)
Canton & Company | Capstone project via UTA & Erick Mwangi @Canton & Company

• Led and managed a team of 6 data scientists to identify different market segments, players in each segment, their 
capabilities, and the types of clients served by each player in the healthcare domain
• Developed an AI-based generic web scraper for any client website using custom BERT-based language model. This 
improved the market landscape assessment process by optimizing 70% of manual tasks.

Data Scientist May 2020 – May 2021 
Upwork | Remote

• Analyzed ~2.9M customer churn data as a part of a project to optimize marketing campaigns for a client; leading to a 
25% increase in marketing ROI. Presented visualizations and data-driven actionable insights using Tableau dashboards, 
enabling effective tracking of various KPIs.
• Leveraged R (dplyr, ggplot2) and Python (Scikit-learn) to conduct statistical analysis and build predictive models (Linear 
Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost), reducing demand forecasting MAPE by 15% as a part of a project where the 
supply chain efficiency had to be increased. This improvement led to a 20% decrease in stock-outs and overstock 
situations
• Executed A/B tests to evaluate different business strategies, contributing to data-driven decision-making for clients
• Streamlined ETL processes and data pipeline management with SQL, BigQuery, and Apache Spark, slashing data 
processing time by 40% and leading to a 10% sales uptick from timely, data-informed campaigns


### Projects
Passenger dwell time cost benefit analysis research (Federally funded) | Department of Homeland Security (DHS), 
Centre for Accelerating Operational Efficiency (CAOE), University of Arizona, University of Texas at Arlington (link)
• Analyzing all possible factors contributing to increase in passenger dwell times at airports across multiple 
datasets and leveraging them to build a predictive ML model under the mentorship of Prof. Randy Napier.

Litigation Risk Analyzer | Identifying rival Telecom companies for possible future litigation (link) 
• Designed and developed using NLP and concepts of LDA, NMF and topic modelling a ML model which can be 
used by companies to identify potential rivals and safeguard them from possible litigation in future and save 
them millions from possible lawsuits.

Flavors of National Anthem | Classifying anthems based on the type of feelings they project (link) 
• Derive research insights into present society and comparative cultural aspects of different countries through the 
application of NLP and unsupervised ML algos like K Means clustering and DBSCAN for classification and 
projecting the results on world map.

Stock Market Prediction Analysis| Time series data analysis of two rival companies listed on S&P 500 (link)
• Comparative stock price analysis for two rival companies listed using LSTM and ARIMA models

Bank Transaction Prediction | Identifying the type of customer transaction for Wells Fargo (link)
• Developed a predictive model using NLP and the Transformer Language model FinBERT to predict the category 
of bank transaction for customers.
